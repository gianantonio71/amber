red-black trees
B*trees?
I don't think that would be quite right for in-memory data structures
skip lists, splay trees, half-balanced trees, and so on.


Use case

  Fi: A, Bi, ... -> Zi 
  
  g: A -> A'
  
  I want to define easily (with just one statement) the functions:

  Fi': A', Bi, ... -> Zi = Fi(g(A), Bi, ...)
